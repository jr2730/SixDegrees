SixDegrees
================
The idea of this project is find the number of movies (or steps) between any two actors.

The name of the project comes from "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon".
(See more info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon )

This work uses, requires and could not exist without the IMDb JSON API project.
